# MOTHERFUCKIN' UTILITIES

This repo contains all the goddamn codes that aren't tied to any specific project, but can be used as utilities to optimize any sorry-ass system you're running.

# INSTALLATION, MOTHERFUCKER

Before you attempt to mess with ANY of these fucking codes, install EVERYTHING mentioned in the `requirements.txt`.
Don't be a dumb motherfucker. Install it all in one goddamn go in a virtual environment. All the steps are given here, you brain-dead piece of shit.

```bash
python3 -m venv <your stupid-ass env name>
source <your stupid-ass env name>/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt, BITCH!
```
If you did not read it properly and copy-pasted it with the word 'BITCH!', just fucking DIE. You don't deserve these codes anymore.
NOW you can fuck around with these scripts. Don't come crying to me if you don't follow these simple-ass instructions!

# 1. DuplicateDetective

This magnificent bastard is for all you disorganized motherfuckers who can't keep your shit straight - copying the same goddamn file in 20 different places like some memory-wasting asshole, then forgetting to clean up your mess!
A high-performance, multi-threaded tool for finding and analyzing duplicate files across your sorry excuse for folders.

## FEATURES, MOTHERFUCKER

- **Fast-ass scanning**: Uses parallel processing to scan large directories faster than you can say "What's in your wallet?"
- **Smart-ass detection**: Two-phase detection using file size and xxHash because we ain't playing around with this shit
- **Detailed fucking reporting**: Identifies the most duplicated files and the biggest space-wasting sex offenders
- **Resource-efficient as fuck**: Optimized so it won't choke your system like you choke yo mama

## USAGE

```bash
python3 duplicate_detective.py -f /path/to/folder1 /path/to/folder2 -df /path/to/DuplicateReport.txt
```

## OUTPUT

Generates a comprehensive motherfucking report showing:
- Total duplicate files and how much space you've wasted, you careless bastard
- Most duplicated file by count (SHAME ON YOU!)
- Largest waste of space by size (THIS IS WHY YOU CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS!)
- Complete list of all duplicates with their paths, sizes and all that memory you pissed away

Now reclaim your disk space, motherfucker! Target those problematic duplicates like Jules Winnfield on a mission!
